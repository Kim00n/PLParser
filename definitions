Find below the definition of the concept used and the class who supported these concepts:

[Token Type]
    Description:
        This object describe a type of token.
    Class: tokenType
    Attributes:
        * Token Type
        * Pattern
    Methods:
        *
    The rules defining the types are specified in the file syntaxConfig.json

[Token]
    Description:
        This object will store a token as identified from the source

[SingleToken Rule]
    Description:
        This object will take care of handling one token rule.
        The token rule is composed like <value>.<id><occ>
        - <value> is mandatory. it is the expected value to match. if it need a space, the value can be within quotes.
        - .<id> is optional. like value it's a word that can be within quotes
        - <occ> define the expected occurrences. It can be like in regex ? * + or [min,max] (where min and max are numbers)
        NOTE: the <value> and <id> can start by a modifier like ! (for non match), > or <
        Examples of singleToken rule:
            test        :will match value 'test' case not sensitive
            'my test'   :will match value 'my test' case sensitive
            .id         :will match token of type 'id'
            !';'.id+    :will match one or more successive token of type 'id' that are not ';'
            .!id*       :will match a succession of token that are not from type 'id', can not be found due to * (=0..n)

[GroupOfTokens Rule]
    Description:
        This object will handle take care of a succession of singleToken rules or group of token rules encapsulated by parenthesis
        Example of GroupOfTokens Rule:
            this is a? test             :will match the sentence 'this is a test' or 'this is test'
            !';' ';'                    :will match any succession of non ';' finished by a ';'
            this is (<content> a test)  :will match the sentence 'this is a test'. 'a test' can be identified as a subgroup called "content"
            this is (a|b)               :will match the sentence 'this is a' or 'this is b'


[GroupOfTokens]
    Description:
    Class:
    Attributes:
        *
    Methods:
        *

[Tokenizer]
    Description:
        Engine in charge of analysing a source file in order to extract out of it one single list of tokens.

[Parser]
    Description:
        Engine in charge of loading the rules and create a list of groupOfTokensRule out of it.
        A source file can be analyze to extract a matching from the rules.
